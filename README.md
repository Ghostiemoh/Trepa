# Trepa | Precision Predictions

Trepa is an innovative prediction platform that rewards users based on the **precision** of their forecasts, rather than just a binary "right" or "wrong" outcome. It encourages nuanced thinking and analytical skill, allowing users to express their confidence levels and earn proportionally to how close their predictions are to reality.

* **Clear "How It Works" Section**: Explains the simple 3-step process of making a precision prediction.
* **Comparison to Traditional Platforms**: Highlights the benefits of Trepa's approach over conventional binary prediction systems.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Structures the web page content.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **JavaScript**: Powers the interactive elements, including reward calculations, dynamic updates for prediction cards and the calculator, FAQ accordion functionality, and the mobile navigation toggle.
* **Font Awesome**: Provides the icons used throughout the design.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, simply save the provided HTML content as an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in your web browser. All necessary CSS (Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome) and JavaScript are loaded directly from CDNs, so no local installation or build process is required.

### Local Setup

1.  Save the entire provided code into a file named `index.html`.
2.  Open `index.html` with your preferred web browser.

## How It Works

Trepa operates on a simple yet powerful principle:

1.  **Slide to Predict**: Instead of just "Yes" or "No," you use a slider to indicate your confidence level (e.g., 75% chance BTC hits $120K).
2.  **Stake Your Claim**: You back your prediction with a monetary stake.
3.  **Earn Based on Accuracy**: Once the outcome is known, your reward is calculated based on how close your prediction was to the actual result. The closer you are, the more you earn. Perfect predictions receive a bonus multiplier!

* **How It Works Section**: Explains the core mechanics of the platform in three simple steps.
* **Why Trepa Section**: Compares Trepa's precision-based approach to traditional binary prediction methods.
* **Reward Calculator Section**: An interactive tool for users to experiment with predictions, outcomes, and stakes to see potential rewards.
* **Call to Action Section**: Encourages users to join the beta waitlist.
